# Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
