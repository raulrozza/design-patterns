# Design Patterns in Typescript

This repository contains test implementations of various known design patterns. These patterns were implemented following *Alexander's Schvets*' **Dive Into Design Patterns**.

The patterns are implemented in Typescript as a way to further comprehend their purposes. These patterns are design for use in Object Oriented programming, but as Typescript can also be used in functional programming, I tried my best to build analogous implementations as well.
